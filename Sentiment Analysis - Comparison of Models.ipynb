    "Social media is widely used to express one‚Äôs opinion on a particular topic. The textual data available in tweets on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram posts, comments on YouTube, etc. is present in an unstructured format. Further, people may express their thoughts using different colloquialisms or slangs and emoticons. As a result, understanding or processing this data is a challenge. However, processing this data can yield significant insights into what people think about a company‚Äôs products and can be leveraged in marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis, often known as opinion mining, is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to determine the emotional element of a document. This is a common technique used by organisations to analyse product reviews, customer feedback and survey results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, sentiment analysis is performed on tweets using different supervised machine learning approaches. A performance comparison of each model is provided."

    "It can be seen that 4th, 5th and 6th November 2022 recorded the top three highest number of tweets regarding Pizza Hut. This is possibly due to a greater number of people ordering pizza on weekends. This hypothesis is proven by Figure 9 since 4th, 5th and 6th November 2022 are Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Hence, there are more number of tweets on days with more orders."

Stratified K-fold cross-validation was chosen as it is better for imbalanced data sets since it ensures equal representation of all classes across each fold. Further, hyperparameter tuning was performed for the random forest classifier and the linear SVC. The random forest classifier‚Äôs number of trees were set to the values 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300.
